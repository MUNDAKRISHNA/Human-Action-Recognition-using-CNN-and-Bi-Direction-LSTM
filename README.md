# Human Activity recognition by cnn+lstm
— To understand human behavior and intrinsically
anticipate human intentions, research into human activity
recognition HAR) using sensors in wearable and handheld
devices has intensified. The ability for a system to use as few
resources as possible to recognize a user’s activity from raw data
is what many researchers are striving for. In this paper, we
propose a holistic deep learning-based activity recognition
architecture, a convolutional neural network-long short-term
memory network (CNN-LSTM). This CNN-LSTM approach
not only improves the predictive accuracy of human activities
from raw data but also reduces the complexity of the model
while eliminating the need for advanced feature engineering.
The CNN-LSTM network is both spatially and temporally deep.
Our proposed model achieves a 99% accuracy on the iSPL
dataset, an internal dataset, and a 92% accuracy on the UCI
HAR public dataset. We also compared its performance against
other approaches. It competes favorably against other deep
neural network (DNN) architectures that have been proposed in
the past and against machine learning models that rely on
manually engineered feature datasets
